# STFC Ocean Scene - 3D Visualization

![Klingon Bird-of-Prey over Ocean](public/screenshot.jpg)

A stunning 3D visualization featuring a Klingon Bird-of-Prey hovering over dynamic ocean waters, with a secondary ship in the foreground. Built with Three.js, React, and Vite.

## 🌟 My STFC Motivation

As an avid player of **Star Trek Fleet Command (STFC)** and proud member of the **ÐŘÅŠ- Ðemons's Řed ÅŠhes🍁 Alliance**, I created this visualization to celebrate my passion for Star Trek and our formidable alliance.

Our alliance motto: *"Through chaos we rise, in unity we conquer!"*

This project reflects the majesty of Star Trek vessels that we command in STFC, particularly paying homage to the mighty Klingon Bird-of-Prey that has served me well in countless battles.
